# Library-Management-System_java
A console-based Library Management System developed using Java. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, and methods to manage book issuing and returning operations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a console-based Library Management System developed using Java.
It allows users to:
View book details,
Issue a book,
Return a book,
Exit the system.
---> The program uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to manage library operations efficiently.

============================================================================================


🚀 Features

✔️ Display book details,
✔️ Issue book with availability check,
✔️ Return book,
✔️ Book ID validation,
✔️ Menu-driven system,
✔️ Continuous execution using loop.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java,
Scanner Class,
Arrays,
OOP Concepts (Class, Object, Constructor, Methods),
Conditional Statements,
Looping (while loop).

🧠 OOP Concepts Used
🔹 Class

Library class represents a book entity.

🔹 Constructor

Initializes:

Book ID

Book Name

Issue Status

🔹 Methods

showBook() → Displays book details

issueBook() → Issues book if available

returnBook() → Returns issued book

🔹 Objects

Three book objects are created in an array.

⚙️ How the Program Works

The system initializes 3 books.

A menu is displayed:

1 → Show Book Details

2 → Issue Book

3 → Return Book

4 → Exit

The user enters Book ID.

The system searches the book using array.

Based on the choice, the respective method is executed.
